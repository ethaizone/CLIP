CLIP Framework
==============

CLIP is PHP Framework that make for who want write PHP for CLI (Command-line Interface). This framework has route system that good for CLI work. Route system is something like goto function that work across many files.  In future, you will see more class for you can make some tools with PHP knowledge. In my private use, I make image downloader with this.

Target of this framework is you can make PHP script that can work without Apache or MySQL and you can pack your script with PHP to work any computer easier.

This framework is in beta public test so "Use at your own risk".
